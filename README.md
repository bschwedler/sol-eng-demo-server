## Disclaimers

We love open source!! However, these resources have a very narrow vision for a
very specific environment. If you are looking for a bit more generic solution
that may apply better to your environment, we suggest you check out some of the
following resources:

- [R Builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds)
- [docker-r-session-complete](https://github.com/sol-eng/docker-r-session-complete),
  which these resources are based on
- [The docker-r-session-complete images](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/r-session-complete)
- [An overview of the job launcher](https://solutions.rstudio.com/launcher/overview/)
